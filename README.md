a Spring Boot service that exposes a REST API that allows a user to request change for a given bill.`

NOTES:

Hi ADP Code Reviews,

First of all I want to thank you all for giving me this opportunity. I did have a lot of fun out of the coding assessment. I know it's not perfect cuz also had a time constraints and my current work but I did my very best of my ability to check all from tasks checklist.

Had it in Spring Boot Application enabling Cross Origin Requests - which I found safe for some security reasons, like browsers prohibit AJAX calls  cuz I thought I can build front-end app for my web pages to consuming the service produce by backend API. But it took almost of a time to setup and install npm packages in node. So I just stick to Restful API Spring Boot Application.

I added a KanBan Project Board in this repo intendedly to track my progress and the items that I have to work. Please feel free to check my notes, comments and my challenges. =) Some of the tasks I hadn't really finished completely but other than that mostly of the requirements I did try to accomplish everything. It was really fun though.

Warm Regards,
AJ
