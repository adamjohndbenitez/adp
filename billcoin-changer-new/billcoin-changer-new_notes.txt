Big picture: Weâ€™re going to create a simple bill-coin changer service that manages to change a bill from request.
 - Store employee objects in a (H2 in-memory) database
 - Access them (via something called JPA).
 - Wrap that with something that will allow access over the internet (called the Spring MVC layer).

@Entity is a JPA annotation to make this object ready for storage in a JPA-based data store.
